# service.subtitles.rvm.addic7ed

This ia a subtitles plugin for [Kodi](www.kodi.tv) mediacenter to download
TV series subtitles from [addic7ed.com](http://www.addic7ed.com/) site.

This is a completely independent project that I've created for my personal use.
It has no relations to other Kodi plugins for addic7ed.com site that may exist.
I use it regularly and try to maintain it in working state.

**Warning**: Movie subtitles are not supported! For movies please use other plugins,
e.g. opensubtitles.
